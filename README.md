# RBF_VAM
This is the GitHub Repository for the RBF visualization for VAM. VAM is short for Visual Analysis for Missingness. It is built upon a machine-learning model dataset called the Rashomon dataset. If a machine learning model is in the Rashomon dataset, it has a similar performance to other machine learning models.

Key Characteristics of a Rashomon Dataset:
===
Multiple Valid Models: The dataset should allow for the development of several models that all perform well but provide different insights or explanations.  
Complexity: The dataset may include intricate relationships and features that can be interpreted in multiple ways.  
Diversity in Model Interpretations: Different models trained on the dataset should yield diverse interpretations or feature importances.  
Sensitivity Analysis: The dataset should facilitate analysis of how small changes in data or model parameters affect the outputs and interpretations.  

Purpose:
===
Model Interpretability: To understand how different models interpret the same data and to study the robustness of model explanations.  
Bias and Fairness: To explore how different models might exhibit biases or fairness issues in various ways despite similar performance.  
Ensemble Methods: To analyze the benefits of combining multiple models to achieve better generalization and robustness.
