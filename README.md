# RBF VAR(Visual Analysis for Rashomon Set)
This is the GitHub Repository for supporting paper *"VAR: Visual Analysis for Rashomon Set of Machine Learning
Models' Performance"*. VAR is short for Visual Analysis for Rashomon Set. It is built upon a machine learning(ML) model dataset called the Rashomon dataset. If an ML model is in the Rashomon dataset, it has a similar performance to other machine learning models in this dataset. The visual analysis(VA) system is built upon a Rashomon-collecting application of the treefarms.

Key Characteristics of a Rashomon Dataset
===
Multiple Valid Models: The dataset should allow for the development of several models that all perform well but provide different insights or explanations.  
Complexity: The dataset may include intricate relationships and features that can be interpreted in multiple ways.  
Diversity in Model Interpretations: Different models trained on the dataset should yield diverse interpretations or feature importances.  
Sensitivity Analysis: The dataset should facilitate analysis of how small changes in data or model parameters affect the outputs and interpretations.  

Goal
===
Model Interpretability: To understand how different models interpret the same data and to study the robustness of model explanations.    
Bias and Fairness: To explore how different models might exhibit biases or fairness issues in various ways despite similar performance.    
Ensemble Methods: To analyze the benefits of combining multiple models to achieve better generalization and robustness.
